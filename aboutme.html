      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I am working towards my (CDA) certification, with the career goal of becoming a proficient and skilled preschool or high school teacher. Growing up, I was unsure of what career path I wanted to take. It was when I saw my cousin teaching in early childcare that I became inspired. I realized how fulfilling it is to work with children and help shape their futures. From teaching them basic skills to being a positive role model, I thoroughly enjoyed every moment I spent working in early childcare.
I'm doing my best in the class, from helping the teacher in what she needs me do and help the students with their. I just turn my work in early and work on something and keeping my self busy all the time.
My values are high and when I think I failed that's when I think that I didn't do my best that I know I can do. but the best value I have is helpfulness because I don't think about me I think about others.
 I one of my short goals is to move to a different state and get away and start new. Other short goal is to get a real estate license that's something else I want to do. 
What my character traits is that I'm funny when you know me, I stand on business when I need to. What I want to be know for is how I help someone in their life and always being remembered as the teacher that change their life  </p>
